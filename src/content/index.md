I am **Lucas**, a software engineer from **Portugal** living in **Paris, France**.

In my spare time I am passionate about building products, learning from it, and contributing to open-source projects. I also love **cold weather** and **mountain hikes**.

#### Open Source Software:

- [barecms.dev](https://barecms.dev): lightweight, open-source headless CMS designed with bare minimalism in mind.
- Maintainer at [workout.cool](https://github.com/Snouzy/workout-cool), helping shape an open-source workout tracker and supporting contributors.
