I am **Lucas**, a software engineer from **Portugal** living in **Paris, France**.

In my spare time I am passionate about building products, learning from it, and contributing to open-source projects.

#### What I've Built:

A [command-line tool](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/go-gituser) to switch easily between git accounts.

An open-source [resume builder](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/resumme-builder) allowing you to generate a resume using HTML/CSS templates and JSON data.

#### What Iâ€™m Working On:

A [personal finance app](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/meffin-front) that calculates a monthly budget by saving recurrent or temporary transactions.

A [recipe app](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/recipio-app) dedicated to preserving family and personal recipes by generating personal or family pages.

An open-source [headless cms](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/barecms) with the bare minimal.
