I am **Lucas**, a full stack engineer from **Portugal** living in **Paris, France**.

In my spare time I am passionate about building software, learning from it, and contributing to open-source projects.

#### What I'm currently building:

[PingBuddy.io](https://pingbuddy.io): A website monitoring service that helps small website owners keep track of their site’s uptime with ease. I’m focused on making it simple and affordable, with features like real-time website checks, notifications, and status pages.

#### I have some open source projects:

A [command-line tool](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/go-gituser) to easily switch between git accounts.\
An open-source [resume builder](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/resumme-builder) that generates resumes using HTML/CSS templates and JSON data.\
A minimal [headless CMS](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/barecms) designed to cover the bare essentials of content management.

#### I've also built:

A [personal finance app](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/meffin-front) that calculates monthly budgets by saving recurring or one-time transactions.\
A [recipe app](https://github.com/lucasnevespereira/recipio-app) dedicated to preserving family and personal recipes, creating personal or family pages to organize them.
